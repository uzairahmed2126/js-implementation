# Comparison Operators
>A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values.
```JavaScript
// it's answer is false
let a = 2;
let b = 8;
let c = a==b;
console.log(c)
```
